## `Getting Started`

To get a local copy of this project:

Clone this repository or download the Zip folder:
```
git clone git@github.com:KDlamini/space-travellers-hub.git
```

To get started, In the project directory, you can run:
```
npm install
```
run react app and open in browser:
```
npm start
```
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

If you encounter an issue related to eslint or webpack version conflict run:
```
npm audit fix --force
```

## `Tests`
To check development tests run:
```
ynpm run test
```
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.


### To track linter errors locally follow these steps:  

Track CSS linter errors run:
```
npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}"
```
Track JavaScript linter errors run:
```
npx eslint .
```

## `Deployement`
```
npm build
```
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
